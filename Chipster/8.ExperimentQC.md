* Similarities & dissimilarities between samples

    * Do the groups seperate out?
    * is there confounding factor(Batch effect) that needs to be taken care of?
    * Are there Outliers?

* Methods:

    * MDS - edgeR (Multi Dimensional Scaling) (??)

        Distances correspond to logFC or BCV (biological coefficient of variation)

        Calculated using 500 heterogenous genes which have large dispersion as a group
    
    * PCA - DESeq2(Principal component analysis) (??)

        PC calculated after variance stabilizing transformation (??)

        Indicates proportion of variance explained by individual components

    * Clustering - Heatmap DESeq2

        Eucledian distance calculated after variance stabilizing transformation
