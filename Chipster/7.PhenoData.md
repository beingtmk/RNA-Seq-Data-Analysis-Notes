# [Describing experimental setup with phenodata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilC7eh-y6Tw&list=PLjiXAZO27elABzLA0aHKS9chVA2TldoPF&index=9)

* Combine individual count files into a count table ([Use Utilities/ Defined NGS experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eptYuRs2qws&list=PLjiXAZO27elABzLA0aHKS9chVA2TldoPF&index=10))
* Table of counts & Phenodata file(allows to describe experimental setup) is generated
* You can import Count table to generate Phenodata
* Phenodata will contain groups (Control, Cancer ...), Sample Name etc.

* NGS - Next Generation Sequencing

    Massive parallel sequencing or massively parallel sequencing is any of several high-throughput approaches to DNA sequencing using the concept of massively parallel processing
