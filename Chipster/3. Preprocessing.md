# [Preprocessing: Trimming and filtering reads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKTGqatq6HI&list=PLjiXAZO27elABzLA0aHKS9chVA2TldoPF&index=3)


* Filtering is removing the entire Read while Trimming removes only bad quality bases

* Paired end data: the matching order of the reads in the two files need to be preserved


* Base Quality Threshold - Trade-off, having good quality reads & having enough reads

* Software: Trimmomatic Usage
    
    * Remove Adaptors
    * Minimum Quality vs Minimum length tradeoff
    * Paired End data etc..
